Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')

Function (doubleL): It's a function that generates a list of values, where each value 
is the result of doubling the corresponding index in the range from 0 to n-1.

For Loop: Iterates over the elements of the list returned by doubleL(5) and prints each element followed by a colon and a space.

Type of Function: List-Generating Function: This function creates and returns a list 
containing the doubled values.

Advantage: Readability and Explicitness: This approach is more explicit about 
the creation of the list, making it easy to understand the logic for someone 
reading the code.

Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

List Comprehension: It generates a list where each element is the result of doubling 
n for each n in the range from 0 to 4.

For Loop: Iterates over the elements of the list created by the list comprehension and prints each element followed by a colon and a space.

Type of Function:

List Comprehension: It's not a function but a concise way to create a list.

Advantage: Conciseness and Readability: This approach is more concise and often considered more Pythonic, especially for simple operations on elements.

Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')

Generator Function (doubleG): It's a generator function that yields values (doubled) 
one at a time as requested.

For Loop: Iterates over the values yielded by the generator and prints each value followed by a colon and a space.

Type of Function:

Generator Function: It's a generator function because it uses yield to 
produce a sequence of values.

Advantage: Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce values on-the-fly and 
do not store the entire sequence in memory, making them memory-efficient. 
This is advantageous when dealing with large datasets or when values are 
only needed as they are used.

Summary: 
Approach 1 and Approach 2 both use lists, where Approach 1 uses a traditional loop and Approach 2 uses a list comprehension.
Approach 3 uses a generator function (doubleG), which yields values one at a time and is memory-efficient.
